Adds a compatibility layer for Foundation Framework and Toolset Layouts plugin to provide a drag and drop layout generator for WP-Forge Foundation theme.

## Description

The Layout plugin is intended to easily integrate drag and drop functionalities into your Foundation based theme. Layouts can be created with an advanced and complete layout editor.

The Layout plugin sits on a flexible and powerful API which lets you create your custom cell components, in a way very similar to the one you are familiar when you create post types and their meta boxes, and integrate them in the Layout editor and in your theme design.

As a theme author, a developer or an advanced WordPress user you will be able to customise the layout and content you render with the plugin to the point that 80% of editing work, can be done with the Layout editor.

This tiny plugin provides a compatibility layer to render Foundation grid markup, image responsiveness and dropdown menus within WP-Forge Foundation based Wordpress theme.

The plugin code can be used as boilerplate code for any theme using Foundation framework, minimal integration can be achieved with few little changes in the provided code.

## Installation

1. Upload 'wp-layout' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
